### About

------------

![playgrounded-code-screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/kB8JRCY/playgrounded-code.png)

playgrounded-code is a simple but effective code playground for html, css and javascript. It allows you to have a live view of your code working (or not ðŸ˜‰)

### Installation

------------


the first step is, as always, to clone this repo. Once you have done with that, move to the repo directory and execute:
`$npm install`

to run the project in dev mode execute:
`$npm run dev`

due to an incompatibility of some web browsers like mozilla firefox with the web workers in the dev mode, the project will not perform as expected, for this cases i recommend to run a production build with the command:

`$npm run build`

after the build is complete run :

`$npm run preview`

**you can also find a live demo of this project at [playgrounded-code](https://playgrounded-code.vercel.app "playgrounded-code") **
